# hello-world
Creating my first repository

Starting my journey back into coding as I fail into engineering. I will hopefully, one day, be known for finding a way to add the missing S for Security in IoT

If I fail, I blame Paul Thurrott. If I succeed, I thank Steve Gibson. 

P.S. and one day Mary Jo Foley will recommend a beer I have brewed
